# Plans
### Didn't think to make a .md before!

# Making the Cards clickable --> onClick() => show 'Stats' in Right Container
- On card click, display that Pokemons stats in PokemonInfo
- Need to pass something to PokemonInfo? The individual pokemon perhaps (pokemon var)?
- Once PokemonInfo has the data, display information on the page?
