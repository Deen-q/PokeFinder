# Pok√©Finder
A simple 'PokeDex' i.e., an encyclopedia of Pokemon. The first React I created by myself to help solidify my understanding.

## Status
I have hosted Pok√©Finder since the base app is complete. I did have more plans for improvement, but I have put it on the back-burner for a number of reasons:
- The job market for junior roles is incredibly cut-throat right now and a basic Pok√©mon app doesn't make me stand out. I have since focused on more intense projects focused around cloud microservices and .NET.
- It was primarily a learning tool during the beginning of my journey.
- There are already incredible apps that exist already that do this job (Pok√©mon Showdown and Serebii for example).
- I lost interest in this app since it is quite simple. Still, I'm proud of how far I've come üòÅ

Special thanks to <a href='https://github.com/Kirti-salunkhe'>Kirti Salunkhe</a> for the DESIGN inspiration - splitting the page in 2 plus the colour palette really appealed to me.

Note: the code is completely different in my project. Regardless, the tutorial was very useful in the beginnings of my app since at the time, I was new to React!
