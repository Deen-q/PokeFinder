# Pokemon App
As of right now the app is a simple 'PokeDex' i.e., an encyclopedia of Pokemon. 
## UPDATES to come:
- Improve the UI/UX i.e., so that it is more intuitive with a modern design
- Add other interesting features such as creating a team of 6 Pokemon, (like in the game!)
- Potential to add a database, say non-relational due to the image/stat relationship (or simply make team building use local storage, rather than a db)
