# Pokemon App
As of right now the app is a simple 'PokeDex' i.e., an encyclopedia of Pokemon. 
## UPDATES to come:
- Improve the UI/UX i.e., so that it is more intuitive with a modern design
- Add other interesting features such as creating a team of 6 Pokemon, (like in the game!)
- Potential to add a database, say non-relational due to the image/stat relationship (or simply make team building use local storage, rather than a db)

Special thanks to <a href='https://github.com/Kirti-salunkhe'>Kirti Salunkhe<a/> for the DESIGN inspiriation - splitting the page in 2 plus the colour palette really appealed to me.

Note: the code is completely different in my project. Regardless, the tutorial was very useful in the beginnings of my app, especially for a novice like myself!
